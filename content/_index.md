**Hello, and welcome to my website!** <br> 
I'm Anish Goyal, frequently known by my username *anish1108* and *anishkgoyal* in international hacking and competitive programming competitions. I‚Äôm currently a freshman pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a minor in Mathematics at Georgia Southern University‚Äôs Honors College, and I plan to enter academia with a Ph.D. in quantum computing. I occasionally post writeups on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and editorials for mathematical journals and competitive programming contests. I'm continually seeking to expand my understanding of niche topics in computer science, mathematics, cybersecurity, and physics.
