**Hello, and welcome to my website!** <br> 
I'm Anish Goyal, frequently known by my username *anish1108* and *anishkgoyal* in international hacking and competitive programming competitions. I‚Äôm currently a freshman pursuing a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering and a minor in physics at Georgia Southern University‚Äôs Honors College, and I plan to enter academia with a Ph.D. in quantum computing. I occasionally post [writeups](/writeups) on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and [editorials](/editorials) for mathematical journals and competitive programming contests. I'm continually seeking to expand my understanding of niche topics in computer science, mathematics, cybersecurity, and physics.

### `history`
#### Early Life
I was once a 6-year-old who loved playing flash games in my web browser and building with LEGOs when I discovered [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlkMs4ZHHr8) about an $A^*$ pathfinding algorithm for Super Mario, which intrigued me enough to replicate it in Java. As I grew older, I developed a natural intuition for problem-solving through my love for video games, math, and computer science.

#### High School
I was introduced to cybersecurity and algorithmic programming through my high school's computer science club, and I've been captivated ever since. In the summer of 2023, I participated in the [Georgia Governor's Honors Program](https://gosa.georgia.gov/governors-honors-program) (GHP) for Engineering: Computer Programming, which was my first exposure to research in a professional setting. At GHP, I developed a robotic hand that translated spoken language into American Sign Language in real-time using cost-effective components and advanced speech processing. 

I left GHP feeling more confident in my abilities as a programmer and decided to continue pursuing research via a project I did in senior year. The project, an autonomous biomimetic submersible with a Zebrafish-inspired propulsion system, was a finalist in the [Georgia Science and Engineering Fair](https://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/youth/academic-competitions/georgia-science-and-engineering-fair) and received second in category for *Robotics & Intelligent Machines*. I also competed in the [USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org/) gold division, Lockheed Martin's CYBER QUEST/CODE QUEST, the [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, and the [American Computer Science League](https://www.acsl.org/), where I won several awards.

#### Post-High School
After graduating, I competed in various CTF competitions with my previous team, [welovepython<3](https://ctftime.org/team/283017/), placing highly in GPN CTF, BCACTF, vsCTF, Google CTF, and Interlogica CTF, winning cash prizes. I was also selected to participate in the Season IV Cyber Combine with the [United States Cyber Games](https://www.uscybergames.com/), a rigorous summer program that selects the top fifteen cybersecurity professionals to represent the United States in the [International Cyber Security Challenge](https://icc.ecsc.eu/). Although I did not make the final team, the experience was invaluable, and I was invited to join their mentorship program, known as the Pipeline Program.

Over the summer, I attended the [Jane Street Academy of Math and Programming](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/amp/) (AMP), a 5-week summer program hosted in NYC, with a rigorous curriculum focused on computer science, combinatorics, and number theory. Meeting like-minded rising college freshmen and learning from professors from various R1 research institutions and seasoned traders at Jane Street was the final push that inspired me to pursue a career in academia.

After AMP, I flew to Las Vegas to compete at B-Sides Las Vegas, where my team placed 1st in [Pros vs. Joes CTF](www.prosversusjoes.net). I also attended the [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org/) security conference, where I competed in Red Team Village CTF and Radio Hacking Village CTF with a team of professional hackers from [Dark Wolf Solutions](https://www.darkwolfsolutions.com/), placing 4th and 3rd, respectively. I also attended talks on quantum computing and cryptography, which further solidified my interest in those fields from a research perspective.

#### Research
When I'm not working on coursework, I'm doing [research](/research) in quantum computing, machine learning, and mathematics. Currently, I'm working on the following projects:
- How ultra-cold atoms manipulated by lasers and magnetic fields can be used to create quantum interferometry devices for rotation sensors and gyroscopes (related video on quantum interferometry [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFM9HHB9JXI))
- A Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network for predicting the reliability of power electronic converters in inverter-based photovoltaic systems, leveraging a decade of real-world data to reduce maintenance costs for large-scale integration of solar energy in power grids
- Applying [Zeckendorf's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem) to higher orders and exploring the properties of generalized Zeckendorf expansions, which are used in number theory to represent integers as sums of Fibonacci numbers
- ConcreteNet: a convolutional neural network architecture that specializes in detecting and classifying structural deformities in concrete via ground-penetrating radar scans
- [The Rogers-Ramanujan-Slater Database](https://rrsdb.github.io/index.html), an online collection of q-series product signatures relating to the Rogers-Ramanujan/Rogers-Slater identities, which are used to study partitions of natural numbers
- Continuing my high school research on biomimetic propulsion systems for autonomous underwater vehicles by conducting more experiments and incorporating LIDAR technology/computer vision to improve navigation

#### STEM Outreach
Other than research, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others and advancing equity in STEM education. When I was in high school, I revived *CyberDragons*, my school's cybersecurity club, and led my peers to excel in cybersecurity competitions through interactive weekly workshops. I also worked closely with Girls Who Code to host workshops on computer science topics at elementary/middle schools and create an all-girls cybersecurity team. In the near future, I hope to become a content creator and produce high-quality videos that teach quantum computing and cybersecurity concepts to a broader audience.

#### Campus Initiatives
Under the Georgia Southern College of Science and Mathematics, I tutor students in mathematics (from College Algebra to Calculus II) and Physics I/II. I'm also the vice president and cofounder of the *Society of Collegiate Engineers*, an experiential learning organization that partners with passionate students from the Georgia Southern College of Engineering and Computing to work on high-impact multidisciplinary projects to serve the community. Finally, I am involved with my school's [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and [American Society of Nondestructive Testing](https://www.asnt.org/) chapters in designing autonomous robots for the SoutheastCon Hardware Competition and offering workshops on nondestructive testing methods, such as ultrasonic testing and magnetic particle inspection, respectively.

#### My Blog
And of course, I enjoy making posts on my [blog](/blog). I share my thoughts on a variety of topics, such as:
- quantum physics
- computer science
- applied mathematics
- cybersecurity and digital privacy
- Linux and <abbr title="Free/Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>
