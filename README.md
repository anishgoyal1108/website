## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, a minimalist and privacy-conscious static site built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The site features:

- **Blog posts** and **cybersecurity competition write-ups** synchronized with an Obsidian Vault, deployed automatically using GitHub Actions.
- **Fast content delivery**, with a focus on minimal JavaScript, no intrusive ads, and no user tracking.
- Hosted on **AWS** with a **Caddy** server backend, ensuring efficient and secure site delivery.

The website reflects my interests in minimalism, privacy, and cybersecurity, and is designed to be lightweight and easy to navigate.
